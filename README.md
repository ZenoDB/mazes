First big project so don't judge :)

Using recursive backtracking and dead end filling to generate and solve mazes, and pycharm to display them along with a GUI.

I still want to try creating a system to input a maze based off of a picture taken from a camera, but maybe another day. Also want to work on other algorithms so it can generate and solve non perfect mazes.
